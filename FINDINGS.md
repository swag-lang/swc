# Swag Findings

This file records compiler, standard-library, tooling, and language-design issues discovered while
working on otherwise unrelated tasks. An entry is a lead worth preserving, not a commitment to
implement it.

It is not a roadmap. Intent — what a subsystem should become and in which order — lives in the
matching `TODO.md`: [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the compiler, its `doc` and `format` commands, and the
language; `bin/std/modules/<module>/TODO.md` and `bin/apps/modules/<app>/TODO.md` for everything
under `bin`. This file holds evidence; those files hold intent. An entry that graduates into a
plan moves there and disappears from here.

Fix a finding immediately when it is sufficiently understood, relevant to the current task, and
safe to validate. Add it here when it needs separate investigation, broader design work, or stronger
evidence. Search before adding an entry, enrich existing entries instead of duplicating them, and
remove or update entries when later work resolves or disproves them.

### A reference to a nullable slot escapes the whole nullability system

- Area: compiler
- Found while: checking whether the postfix `!` leaks `readonly` (it does not — `readonly`
  deliberately "restricts writing through the field's name; it does not freeze the whole value",
  [002_009_visibility_and_exports.swg:107-109](bin/reference/modules/language/src/002_009_visibility_and_exports.swg#L107-L109))
- Observation: `&#null *T` — a reference bound to a nullable slot, which is exactly what
  `Array.opIndex` hands back — is not seen as nullable anywhere. `isNullable()` is asked of the
  reference, and a reference is never nullable, so: the use-site rules let a member access through
  it compile with no proof at all, and the postfix `!` is a silent no-op on it. The nullability
  system simply does not apply to values reached through a reference.
- Evidence: with `mtd const at()->const &(#null *Item)`, `bound.value` compiles unguarded and
  `#typeof(bound.value)` reports `#null *Item` rather than the field type — member resolution
  peels one pointer-or-reference layer and then stops, so it never reaches the struct.
  `#typeof(bound!)` is unchanged by the assertion.
- Next step: this needs three coordinated changes, which is why an attempt was reverted rather
  than half-shipped. (1) The use-site check must look through the reference
  (`SemaHelpers::unwrapAliasRefType` in `resolveMemberAccess`). (2) `notNullUnwrappedTypeRef` must
  strip `Nullable` INSIDE the reference — rebuilding `&(#null *T)` as `&*T` rather than dropping
  the reference, so the payload convention is untouched. (3) Member resolution must peel every
  reference layer and then exactly one pointer (`**T` must still stop after one), and codegen must
  do the matching double indirection — step 3 is where the reverted attempt failed: it compiled
  but read the wrong address at run time. Start with a runtime test for `bound!.value`, since that
  is what catches the codegen half.

### Golden snapshots cannot be recorded under the test sandbox

- Area: compiler | bin/std
- Found while: regenerating the gui widget goldens after the theme-atlas format change
- Observation: `swc test` always arms the sandbox, and the sandbox refuses every write outside
  its root. The golden store's documented flows — create a missing golden on first run, write
  `<name>.actual.txt`/`.png` next to a mismatching golden for `tools/goldens.bat` —
  both write into the module source tree, so they silently stopped working when the sandbox
  landed: a failing golden reports `[golden] cannot write ...` and leaves nothing to accept.
- Evidence: the 13 gui golden mismatches printed `cannot write` for every actual; recording them
  required launching the tests with an explicit repo-rooted sandbox
  (`--run-arg "swag.sandbox=<repo root>"`), which redirects the special directories into the
  repository and allows the corpus writes.
- Next step: decide where golden actuals should land under a sandbox. Candidates: the launcher
  grants the corpus root explicitly (a `swag.sandbox.corpus=<dir>` run argument the golden store
  consults), or the golden store mirrors actuals under the sandbox root at a deterministic path
  and `goldens.bat` harvests them. Writing straight to the source tree from a
  sandboxed test contradicts the sandbox guarantee, so the escape must stay launcher-owned.

### Constant branches survive until the sanitizer after inlining

- Area: compiler
- Found while: `notnull_access.swg` release-mode sanity false positive (fixed in the sanitizer)
- Observation: inlining `redundant(null)` folds the null test to `%2 = 1; %3 = %2;
  cmp %3, 0; je`, yet no pass folds the constant compare-and-branch before sanity runs, so the
  dead dereference block survives the whole pre-RA pipeline. The sanitizer now prunes the
  infeasible edge itself, but the optimizer keeps emitting the dead block.
- Evidence: `#[Swag.PrintMicro("pre-sanity")]` on a `#test` calling `redundant(null)` shows the
  folded guard and the unreachable dereference block still present at the sanity stage.
- Next step: teach branch-simplify (or const-fold) to evaluate a conditional jump whose flags
  come from a compare against an immediate on a register holding a known constant, then let DCE
  drop the unreachable block; measure code-size impact on the release suites.

### Droppable call-result temporaries are never dropped

- Area: compiler
- Found while: fixing the `String`-rvalue `+=` heap corruption (root cause was the return
  path: `return local` bit-copied and still dropped the local — a use-after-free/double-free
  for any `opDrop`-without-`opPostCopy` struct, and for every inlined `String` return; both
  now move out, see `CodeGenMoveElision::canMoveOutAtReturn`)
- Observation: a call result with a `Drop` lifecycle that lands in a compiler temporary is
  never dropped. `discard makeThing()`, `takeView(makeThing())` through an implicit `opCast`,
  and `acc += Format.toString(...)` all leak the temporary's buffer on every execution;
  `Format.toString` itself leaks its inner `ConcatBuffer.toString` temporary per call.
- Evidence: micro dump of `g_Str += Format.toString(...)` shows no drop call anywhere after
  `String.opAssign`; a Tracer struct counting drops confirms zero drops for the `discard` and
  argument-cast shapes while `var x = makeThing()` drops exactly once.
- Next step: mark function-owned result storages in sema (cast-source, discard, optional
  chains, index temporaries — call-argument storages are callee-dropped and `retval` storages
  are caller-owned, so both stay out), then flush their drops in CodeGen at the end of the
  consuming statement: register `{flushRootRef, storageSym}` at call emission, where the flush
  root is the nearest ancestor that is a block child, and emit the pending drops in the
  generic `postNode` when it closes. Loop conditions need the condition node as flush root.

### A folded `typeinfo ==` answers differently from the same comparison at run time

- Area: compiler
- Found while: fixing `switch` over a `typeinfo`, which compared descriptor addresses and so
  never selected `case string` for a `#null string` (`CodeGenCompareHelpers::emitTypeInfoEqualJump`
  is now the single rule for both `==` and `case`)
- Observation: type identity at run time is the runtime hash, which deliberately ignores the
  qualifiers — `#null string` and `string` are the same type, as `@typecmp` documents. Constant
  folding does not follow that rule: `sameTypeValuePayload` rejects the pair on
  `leftType.flags() != rightType.flags()`. The same source expression therefore reports `false`
  when both sides fold and `true` when either side is a variable.
- Evidence: `alias NullString = #null string; const TN: typeinfo = NullString; #assert(TN ==
  string)` fails, while `var a: typeinfo = NullString; @assert(a == string)` passes
  ([switch_type.swg](bin/unittests/native/flow/switch_type.swg)). A `#run` of a function that
  switches on the same constant does match `case string`, because that comparison goes through
  codegen.
- Next step: decide which answer is the language rule, then make one side follow the other.
  Aligning the fold on the runtime hash is the consistent choice, but `sameTypeValuePayload` also
  answers `#typeof(a) == #typeof(b)` for generic and compile-time code, so the flag comparison has
  to be replaced by the runtime-hash rule (`TypeRuntimeHash`) only where the operands are
  typeinfo values, and the generic paths audited for cases that rely on the stricter answer.

### Data-driven UI resource for `std/gui`

- Area: bin/std
- Found while: simplifying the sCrypt vault cards after `FormCtrl` was judged too heavy
- Observation: a UI described by a data string is only worth it when the caller never needs the
  controls back. The removed `FormCtrl` proved the opposite case: every consumer built an
  `Array'FormFieldDefinition`, then immediately recovered typed pointers by string identifier
  (`notnull (notnull form.findField("create.size")).accessoryChoice`), so the data layer added a
  stringly-typed boundary without removing a single control pointer. A full markup would extend
  that boundary from four fields to the whole window unless the resource is resolved at compile
  time into typed members.
- Evidence: commits 3b382e68a and 8009467a0 removed `FormCtrl`, `FormFieldDefinition`,
  `FormFieldKind`, `FormChoice`, and `FormField` (177 lines) and replaced three consumers with
  `FormLayoutCtrl` builders that return the concrete control. sCrypt's two cards lost their two
  field-description functions and every `findField` lookup. `Core.File.TweakFile` already parses a
  text format onto struct fields through reflection, and `ThemeStyle.addStyleSheetColors` shows the
  existing string-resource precedent in `std/gui`.
- Next step: prototype the compile-time half first, since it is what decides the design. Parse a
  small UI resource in a `#run` block with `TweakFile` as the model, and check whether the parsed
  tree can emit typed member declarations for a window struct through `#code`/generated source. If
  typed accessors cannot be generated at compile time, a UI resource reintroduces exactly the
  lookup boundary the builders just removed, and a resource editor would ship that cost to every
  window. Only then evaluate the editor.

### `#[Swag.Tls]` is accepted and then ignored

- Area: compiler
- Found while: attributing the sCrypt/WinFsp integration working-set growth to the runtime
  allocator rather than to sCrypt or WinFsp
- Observation: the attribute is parsed into `RtAttributeFlagsE::Tls`
  ([AttributeList.h:37](src/Compiler/Sema/Core/AttributeList.h#L37), assigned at
  [Sema.Attributes.cpp:181](src/Compiler/Sema/Ast/Sema.Attributes.cpp#L181)) and never read again;
  no backend emits a thread-local segment. A `#[Swag.Tls]` global is an ordinary shared global, so
  every "one copy per thread" design built on it is silently one shared copy. The language
  reference documents the feature as working
  ([003_005_variables.swg:128-131](bin/reference/modules/language/src/003_005_variables.swg#L128-L131)).
- Evidence: a native program writes `0xAAAA` into a `#[Swag.Tls] var u64` on the main thread; a raw
  `CreateThread` worker reads back `0xAAAA` (a real slot reads 0), writes `0xBBBB`, and the main
  thread then reads `0xBBBB`. The remaining users in `bin/` are `Random.shared()`
  ([random.swg:3](bin/std/modules/core/src/rand/random.swg#L3)) and the Mersenne Twister plus counter
  behind `Guid64`/`Guid128`
  ([guid64.swg:6](bin/std/modules/core/src/system/guid64.swg#L6),
  [guid128.swg:6](bin/std/modules/core/src/system/guid128.swg#L6)), so identifier and random
  streams are raced on and can repeat across threads.
- Next step: decide between implementing the attribute (a `.tls` section and an
  `IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY` in the PE writer and the integrated linker, plus an equivalent under the
  JIT) and rejecting it with a diagnostic. Either way the remaining `bin/` users need a mechanism
  that exists today: an explicit slot through `__tlsAlloc`/`__tlsGetPtr`, which is already how the
  runtime context reaches per-thread storage
  ([os_windows.swg:298](bin/runtime/os_windows.swg#L298)).

### `for &x in f()` corrupts its elements when `f` returns `const &Array'T`

- Area: compiler
- Found while: filling the `sCrypt` language picker from `Gui.languages()`
- Observation: iterating by reference directly over a call that returns `const &Array'T` yields
  elements whose fields are garbage. Binding the call to a pointer first and iterating the
  dereferenced pointer over the same array is correct, so the returned reference itself is sound
  and the defect is in what the `for` binding does with a call result.
- Evidence: `func languages()->const &Array'Language { return g_Localization.languages }` in
  `gui.dll`, then `for &one in Gui.languages() do combo.addItem(one.nativeName.toString())` in
  `sCrypt`: `String.opSet` receives a garbage count and the run dies on `Memory.alloc returned
  null`. `let all = &Gui.languages()` followed by `for &one in dref all` over the same data is
  correct. The same source shape run in the module's own test binary did not fault, so the symptom
  needs the shared-library boundary or a particular allocation layout.
- Next step: reduce it to two modules — a shared library exporting `Array'T` by `const &` and an
  executable iterating the call by reference — and inspect what the `for` lowering binds to: a
  temporary copy that is dropped before the body would explain both the garbage and why taking the
  address first is sound. Deciding whether a container should be returned by reference at all is
  the design half of the question; the API here now returns `const [..] T`, which behaves.

### A per-frame event can be sent but never asked for

- Area: std/gui
- Found while: making the sCapture property panel follow a live language switch
- Observation: `Application.sendFrameEvents` walks `Application.frameEvents`, and nothing in
  the repository ever adds to it. `registerFrameEvent` and `unregisterFrameEvent` are declared
  `internal` and have no caller, so the array is empty for the whole run and the call is a
  no-op every frame. The only `FrameEvent` a window actually receives is the single
  `firstFrame` one `Application.run` sends to each surface view before the loop starts, which
  means `IWnd.onFrameEvent` is a first-frame hook wearing the name of a per-frame one.
- Evidence: `grep -rn registerFrameEvent bin --include=*.swg` returns the two declarations and
  no call. Two consumers already depend on the missing half: `MainWnd.onFrameEvent` in
  sCapture only tests `evt.firstFrame`, so it works by accident, while
  `PropWnd.needRebuild` never drains — `PropWnd.onFrameEvent` is the only place that clears
  it ([propwnd.swg:1025](bin/apps/modules/sCapture/src/propwnd.swg#L1025)) and PropWnd is not
  a surface view, so the deferred rebuild that
  [propwnd.swg:998](bin/apps/modules/sCapture/src/propwnd.swg#L998) asks for after a
  `FormImage.kind` change silently never happens.
- Next step: decide which of the two the interface means. Either publish the registration —
  a `Wnd` flag next to `BeforeChildrenPaint`, or a public `registerFrameEvent` — and send the
  event from `runFrame` to everything registered, which makes `PropWnd.needRebuild` work as
  written; or drop `frameEvents` and `sendFrameEvents` and rename the hook for what it is,
  which then needs a different deferral for a rebuild asked for from inside the grid's own
  change notification (a posted event is the obvious one). Whichever way it goes, the
  `FormImage.kind` rebuild has to end up actually running.

### A fully transparent fill is dropped even under `Copy` blending

- Area: bin/std
- Found while: giving the surface drop shadow its transparent margin back
- Observation: `Painter.fillRect` cannot clear a region to premultiplied nothing. Every fill entry
  point skips a fully transparent source (`color.a == 0`, then `Brush.hasVisibleAlpha`), which is
  right under alpha compositing and wrong under `BlendingMode.Copy`, where the source replaces the
  destination and a transparent fill is the only way to erase. The CPU renderer already states the
  correct rule — `if src.a == 0 and .blendingMode != .Copy`
  ([rendercpu.swg:322](bin/std/modules/pixel/src/render/cpu/rendercpu.swg#L322)) — and so does the
  antialiasing shader, which discards a zero-coverage fragment only when `!copyMode`
  ([aa.frag:31](bin/std/modules/pixel/src/render/ogl/shaders/aa.frag#L31)). The painter contradicts
  both.
- Evidence: with `setColorMaskFull` and `setBlendingMode(.Copy)`, filling a region with
  `Color.fromArgb(0'u8, Argb.Black)` leaves it untouched; the same fill with alpha `1` clears it as
  intended. Routing the two guards through a blend-aware painter predicate was not enough — a third
  cull further down still drops it — so the search has to continue past `fillRect`/`hasVisibleAlpha`
  into `fillRectRaw`, the command packer, or the renderer.
- Next step: find the remaining cull by emitting a `Copy` fill of `a = 0` and one of `a = 1` and
  diffing the recorded command stream, then put one blend-aware predicate on the painter — it owns
  the blending mode, `Brush` does not — and route every `color.a == 0` and `hasVisibleAlpha` guard
  in `src/painter` through it.

### A surface outline must be stroked before its shadow, and nobody knows why

- Area: std/gui
- Found while: moving the surface outline above the hierarchy so docked views stop covering it
- Observation: `Surface.paint` ends with `paintBorder`, `paintShadowOutsideBody`, `paintAlphaMask`.
  Swapping the first two — stroking the outline after the shadow rather than before — costs the
  surface its entire drop shadow, on all four edges, not just where the two meet. The two passes
  touch disjoint regions: the outline is inside the body, the shadow is stencil-clipped to outside
  it. An ordering that matters between disjoint regions means one of them leaves painter or
  renderer state the other depends on, and the order is currently load-bearing by accident.
- Evidence: with the order `paintShadowOutsideBody`, `paintBorder`, the margin of gui1 reads flat
  `#D2D2D2` (the bare backdrop) on every edge; with `paintBorder` first the same build reads a
  clean gradient from `#D2D2D2` down to `#898989` at the body. Nothing else differs.
  `paintBorder` sets `setColorMaskColor` and strokes a pen with `borderPos = .Inside`;
  `paintShadowOutsideBody` opens a clipping region, sets `setColorMaskFull`, and fills rounded
  rectangles. Fixing the separate defect where the alpha channel composited with the source alpha
  as its own factor did not change this: the ordering was retested afterwards and still decides
  whether there is a shadow at all.
- Next step: dump the command stream for both orders and diff it. The suspects are the pen stroke
  path leaving clipping-region or overlap state behind — `StartNoOverlap` defers drawing, and the
  OpenGL renderer skips `DrawTriangles` outright while `overlapMode` is set — and
  `setColorMaskColor` reaching the shadow fills rather than the `setColorMaskFull` that precedes
  them, which would explain the loss exactly, since a shadow written without alpha is invisible to
  the compositor.

# Swag Investigation Backlog

This file records compiler, standard-library, tooling, and language-design issues discovered while
working on otherwise unrelated tasks. An entry is a lead worth preserving, not a commitment to
implement it.

Fix a finding immediately when it is sufficiently understood, relevant to the current task, and
safe to validate. Add it here when it needs separate investigation, broader design work, or stronger
evidence. Search before adding an entry, enrich existing entries instead of duplicating them, and
remove or update entries when later work resolves or disproves them.

## Open Investigations

<!--
Use this compact format. Keep observations factual and make the next step actionable.

### Short descriptive title

- Area: compiler | bin/std | language | tooling | documentation
- Found while: task, test, or file that exposed the issue
- Observation: awkward behavior, suspected defect, or optimization opportunity
- Evidence: reproduction, relevant paths, measurements, or diagnostics
- Next step: smallest useful investigation
- Related: issue, pull request, or TODO entry if applicable

### sCrypt integration working-set growth

- Area: bin/std
- Found while: reproducing an sCrypt WinFsp mount in the privileged integration test
- Observation: the process working set grows far beyond the 64 MiB test container during ordinary
  filesystem scenarios; the test still completes and cleans up normally.
- Evidence: `tools/test-scrypt-integration.bat dm` reached about 760 MiB in release, and the same
  34-scenario run in fast-debug reached about 835 MiB before passing, unmounting `Y:`, and exiting.
  Windows also recorded `RADAR_PRE_LEAK_64` for an earlier sCrypt run.
- Next step: record process heap and working-set deltas at every integration stage and across
  repeated mount/unmount cycles in one process, then attribute retained allocations to sCrypt,
  WinFsp, or the core allocator before changing ownership or allocation policy.
